Integrating reicast in other projects
===

Overview
---
In general, we prefer to have all work done in the canonical repo, and to have as many things as possible merged in master. 

The rationale is that this leads to less dupplicated effort, and the team is more aware/can cherry pick improvements to master.

How to work with the reicast team / downstream obligations
---
- Read the project goals
- Read and follow the colab. guidelines
- Read and follow the project processes
- Sign the CLA
- Keep in mind of how the team wants to steer the project, and understand you are another downstream user among many
- You have to keep the reicast logo/branding and show the version, and such so we can track issues

Benefits of not forking
---
- Unified codebase
- Easy to keep up to date with mainline reicast
- Your users get the same kind of support standalone reicast users get
- People are familiar with the emulator name

When it makes sense to do a hard-fork
---
- You don't agree with the way the project is run, and after discussions with the team you see few common goals
- You don't agree with the quality standards and goals of the project. We generally want to clean the codebase and remove hackfixes, not add more.
- You prefer to use your own branding
