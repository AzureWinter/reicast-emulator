Collaboration Guidelines
===

Be polite to each other
---

No one wants to wake up to a rude reply. Try to behave the best way you can, and show understanding when others are not. 

When things escalate, try to use this document as a guideline on how to de-escalate them.

Think of the project first
---

We're primarily here to make Reicast better.

When discussing things in the tracker, forum or discord, try to think of the project first, and not of personal issues you might have with people.

Strive for: Thinking "Constructive feedback is good because it makes contributors feel accepted, valued and safe. When people feel safe they are more comfortable explaining their opinion/viewpoint, and that helps make the project better"

Avoid: Thinking "Emotionally abusing people is fun and makes my (the abuser's) day better"

Avoid negativity, be realistic, give constructive feedback
---

Before replying, ask yourself the following questions.
- How will the person I'm replying to feel after reading my comment?
- Am I motivating them to get work done, or just spreading negativity?
- Am I giving feedback that is valuable?

Gracefully recover from missteps

We are all humans, and we have emotions and troubles, so often our conduct is not ideal. Here are some ideas on how to get things back on track.
- When not thinking with a clear mind, take a break. Go for a walk, call a friend, stare at TV, smoke a cig, whatever works for you.
- When in the wrong, apologize, and try to not repeat the offending behavior. Remember, an apology is sincere _only_ if it changes your behavior.
- Defend your opinions, but be open to exploring other ideas, especially after a disagreement. "A strong opinion, weakly held"

Remember, we're doing science
---

- Try to convince others based on scientific/rational merit, not personal opinion or emotion. 
- Try to extract knowledge, even when others are behaving in a not-so-nice way. Remember: almost every viewpoint has some value.
- Try to decompose your thinking process and explain it to others, identify leaps of rationality.
- Try to understand other's people's thinking process, and how they decompose the ideas in their heads.
- Communicate without taking things personally

A good rule of thumb is: If you can't explain why something should be done in some way, you're probably not thinking very rationally.

Bad example: C++ is good because I know it
