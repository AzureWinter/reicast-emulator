Project goals
---

- Be a universal dreamcast implementation that provides both 'fast and dirty' and 'slower but accurate' as well as 'really slow but hardware replica' options.
- Limited amount of hacks are accepted, and existing ones should be removed. We strive to understand the underlying hardware behavior, not patch things up to get games running.
- Support as many platforms as possible, from low end 32-bit non-jit enviroments, to multi high end systems and FPGAs
- Have a clean, well tested, well documented codebase
- Be a publicly developed, non-profit project
- Provide credible experience for volunteers, a basic income for long standing members (think: Wikipedia, the linux kernel)
